# JavaFxApplications
My JavaFx Applications.

Hey there,

As we know, **JavaFX** is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich internet applications (RIAs) that can run across a wide variety of devices. 

This repository contains some of the JavaFx applications which I built using **IntelliJ Idea** as the IDE and **Oracle SceneBuilder 2.0** for building the .fxml file.

Note: I've used Lambda Expressions here (ie Java 1.8 is required).

## Contents

* **Student Management Application** - This application simply helps to add all the details of students in a format. After entering the data, the user can save the data. The application will save the data in the form of a text file.

* **BMI Application** - This application simply calculates the BMI by taking the inputs from the user. The application also gives out a remark based on user's BMI. If the user wishes to save the data then he/she can do so. The application will save the data in the form of a text file alongwith the current date and time.

* **TO-DO List Application** - This application takes input from the user about the task and its details ie Date, Time, Priority. The user can add the task to the list which also acts as a Preview of all the progress made in the session. The user then can save the list which will be stored in the form of a text file. The user can also select the option to sort the list. The application also has various other smart features which make the UI experience pleasant.

* **Calculator Application** - This application works as a smart calculator with a clean UI. It has various advanced features and more are will be there shortly. Besides the regular Addition, Subtraction, Division and Multiplication, this application can also calculate Percentage, SquareRoot, Square, Factorial, Inverse and it supports decimal point calculation. More features like N raised to a number, Solving Quadratic equations, Linear Equations, etc will be coming soon. (WIP)
